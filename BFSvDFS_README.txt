John Robinson CSC 462

To operate the code just run through each section in jupyter notebook and the output will be at the end. Not sure if using it is allowed or if there is better way to run python scripts but this is the way I am most familair. One caveat with code is I wasnt sure about the orientation of the tree. I rotated it clockwise so it starts at 200 and goes to 1. The printout at the end after every previous cell has run.
